What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React is a JS library and it tries to solve to the problem of creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces without creating excessive amounts of code - it uses components to create modular, reusable code.

What does it mean to think in react?

Thinking in react mean to think of the data flow of an application and what places state will be used, what changes will be made to it where, and what components will be used to hold that state.

Describe state.

State is what data is currently being displayed to the DOM, or the current state of an element/what it is displaying/what it is i.e. a number, a string, boolean value, etc.

Describe props.

Props are properties that are passed down from parent elements and used to create functions that can change an element's state.

What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects are effects that are created from react after a state changes, and using useEffect in React is a way to pass to a component to create a state or prop change.
